**DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE FOR PROD, I HAVE NOT MITIGATED SIDE CHANNELS YET**

# About
This is a python package for doing fast elliptic curve cryptography, specifically
digital signatures.

## Supported Curves
* P192
* P224
* P256
* P384
* P521

## Performance
Currently it does basic point multiplication significantly faster than the `ecdsa`
package. You can see the times for 1,000 signature and verification operations below,
 `fast.py` corresponding to this package and `regular.py` corresponding to `ecdsa`
 package.

As you can see, this package in this case is ~25x faster.

## Installing
Run `python setup.py install`. Note that you need to have C compiler that
supports the C99  standard. You also need to have [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) on
your system as the underlying C code in this package includes the `gmp.h` header
(and links against gmp via the `-lgmp` flag). On debian you can install all
dependencies as follows:

```
sudo apt-get install python-dev libgmp3-dev
```

## Usage
Some kinks are still being worked out, so far limited usage is as follows:

#### signing and verifying signatures via ECDSA
```python
from fastecdsa import curve, ecdsa

keys = ecdsa.KeyPair(curve=curve.P256)  # use NIST curve P256
m = "a message to sign via ECDSA"  # some message

(r, s) = keys.sign(m)  # standard signature, returns two integers
valid = keys.verify((r, s), m)  # should return True as the signature we just generated is valid.
```

## Security
Current issues are:

* Branching on secret data i.e. non-constant time point multiplication
* Hard coded nonce in the signing algorithm (THIS WILL PWN YOU)

As such *DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE IN PROD FOR ANYTHING REQUIRING ANY CRYPTOGRAPHIC
GUARANTEES / SECURITY CRITICAL APPLICATIONS*.
